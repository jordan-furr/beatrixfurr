                    <h2>HolyBelly: Crafting Memorable Experience</h2>
                    <h4>September 2024 - December 2024</h4>
                    <p>HolyBelly, located in the vibrant 10th Arrondissement, offered a contrasting yet equally
                        enriching
                        experience. As a server in this beloved café, I was on the front lines of customer interaction,
                        cultivating relationships with regulars and newcomers alike. Guided by HolyBelly's motto, “It’s
                        good
                        because we care,” I embraced the responsibility of ensuring every guest felt genuinely welcomed
                        and
                        valued. The fast-paced environment challenged me to balance attentiveness and efficiency,
                        transforming ordinary meals into meaningful moments for guests.

                        The team at HolyBelly operated with camaraderie and mutual respect at its core. I thrived on the
                        energy of the café, from the lively conversations with customers to the
                        satisfaction of orchestrating a seamless dining experience. This role honed my interpersonal
                        skills
                        and reinforced the importance of heartfelt hospitality in building community. HolyBelly’s
                        commitment
                        to care not only shaped its offerings but also left a lasting impact on me, reminding me of the
                        power of intention in service and connection.</p>

                    <h2>P1 Bakery: Bread and Pastry</h2>
                    <h4>May 2024 - July 2024</h4>
                    <p>At P1 Bakery, nestled in the heart of Montmartre, I immersed myself in the meticulous craft of
                        baking. Working in the basement ovens, I became part of a process steeped in tradition, where
                        precision and patience were paramount. My days often began before dawn, shaping croissants,
                        baguettes, and delicate pastries that would later line the shelves of the bustling bakery
                        upstairs.
                        Each loaf and pastry carried the weight of consistency and quality, a testament to the bakery's
                        reputation. Through this hands-on experience, I gained a deeper appreciation for the artistry of
                        breadmaking and the role of rhythm and repetition in achieving excellence.

                        The environment at P1 was as much about teamwork as it was about technique. Working alongside
                        skilled bakers, I learned the unspoken communication required in a kitchen, where timing and
                        collaboration are critical. The physicality of kneading dough and the sensory satisfaction of
                        seeing
                        golden loaves emerge from the oven instilled in me a profound respect for the craft and its
                        connection to community. This role taught me discipline, resilience, and a hands-on approach to
                        creating something tangible that brings joy to others.</p>
