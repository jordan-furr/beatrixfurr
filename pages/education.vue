                    <h2>Ferrandi: Intesive Bread Course</h2>
                    <h4>January 2023 - May 2023</h4>
                    <p>Enrolling in Ferrandi Paris’s three-month intensive bread-making course was a transformative
                        experience that deepened my understanding of traditional French boulangerie techniques. Known as
                        one of the world’s premier culinary schools, Ferrandi offered a hands-on, rigorous immersion
                        into the art and science of bread. From the moment I stepped into their state-of-the-art
                        kitchens, I was surrounded by the intoxicating aroma of freshly baked loaves and a community of
                        passionate bakers.

                        The course was a masterclass in every aspect of breadmaking, from understanding the behavior of
                        different flours and sourdough fermentation to mastering classic French staples like baguettes,
                        pain de campagne, and viennoiseries. Under the guidance of expert instructors, I learned to
                        balance precision with creativity, exploring the chemistry of fermentation and the artistry of
                        shaping dough. The program’s pace was intense, demanding meticulous attention to detail and a
                        commitment to perfection in every loaf.

                        Beyond technical skills, Ferrandi instilled in me a deep respect for the tradition and
                        innovation inherent in French baking. The experience was not just about making bread—it was
                        about understanding its cultural significance, its role in everyday life, and its power to bring
                        people together. This journey honed my craft and inspired me to approach baking with curiosity,
                        care, and a lifelong dedication to quality.</p>
